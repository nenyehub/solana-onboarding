I've been shilling Solana for too long and I often get asked the same questions about why/where/how to start. 

Below is my best attempt at summarizing quality resources for new devs. In theory, this action-list has everything you need to go from wannabe who never coded Rust to proper Solana hacker. 

Enjoy ðŸ¦€âš“ðŸš€

# Why Solana

*Not convinced you should bother? Start here.*

### Read

*I find these 3rd party theses to be most compelling.*

1. [Long post by notboring](https://www.notboring.co/p/solana-summer)
2. [Thesis by multicoin](https://multicoin.capital/2021/05/25/technical-scalability-creates-social-scalability/)
3. [Thesis by sino](https://sinoglobalcap.medium.com/why-we-are-bullish-on-solana-c2be784cfdf6)

### Listen

*I tried to pick a mix of founders shilling their own chain / 3rd party opinions.*

1. [Intro so solana on uncommon core](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVEXSF8uqr0)
2. [Solana founders on upOnly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8wsw1htJFY)
3. [Unchained - can Solana seize marketshare from Eth](https://unchainedpodcast.com/can-solana-seize-marketshare-from-ethereum-with-serum/)? [oct 2020]
4. [Unchained - could sol displace eth](https://unchainedpodcast.com/sol-is-up-3800-ytd-could-it-eventually-displace-ethereum/)? [aug 2021 - almost a year later]

# Learn rust

*Aight you're excited and ready to jump in. Where do you start? You start with Rust (used for coding "programs" aka smart contracts on Solana.)*

1. [Rust crash course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-crash-course/) [4h] - excellent, short and to the point intro. 
2. [The official rust lang book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) [1-2d of intense reading] - will teach you syntax and language quirks. 
    1. +++ don't be lazy and do the [exercises for each chapter](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/tree/main/exercises) 
3. [Zero2Prod](https://www.zero2prod.com/) [1-2 wks of study] - will take you from "I get the syntax" to "I get rust as a programming language and where it's strong/weak".

# Learn Solana

*The juicy part.*

1. Read the ["developing" section](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/overview) of the docs [2-3h] - you will get a lot of questions, but that's ok. Just write them down and you'll be surprised how quickly they get answered as you progress. 
2. [Solana Bootcamp Chicago Jan 22](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLilwLeBwGuK7Z2dXft_pmLZ675fuPgkA0) 8 videos introducing the Solana programming / account model, PDAs, CPIs, runtime limitations, and a few demo programs. The videos are very concise and eloquent.

# Where to get help

*It's ok to be overwhelmed. Here's where you get help.*

- Rust questions
    - Rust community is one of the best I've seen in the dev space. My go to is asking #rust tagged questions on StackOverflow or going to [dedicated rust forums](https://users.rust-lang.org/) if I want to have a bit more of a discussion.
    - Get ready to be amazed! Questions are generally answered within 30min of being asked - that's a totally polar experience to your python/js questions on SO that get 1 reply in 3 days.
    - There's also [Rust discord](https://discord.com/invite/rust-lang-community), if you prefer chats to forums.
- Solana questions
    - In general all the help is available in discord channels such as:
        - [Solana discord](https://discord.com/invite/pquxPsq)
        - [Anchor discord](https://discord.com/invite/xxkZbHzGn6)
        - [Serum discord](https://discord.com/invite/zxPsXcB)
        - [Mango discord](https://discord.com/invite/n8c2YhUYmY)
        - etc
    - First thing to do is always Ctrl-F the discord with any keywords you might have from your error. In general, I'd say 50% of the time someone already had that problem and you'll get an instant answer.
    - If that fails, each protocol usually has some sort of `developer questions` channel. Be specific and to the point with your questions (no "hey this is my first post") and don't feel bad  for re-asking ("still looking for answer to this [reply to own previous question]. Anyone might know?). Worst case CC one of the admins who you see frequenting in the chat.
    
# How to stay up to date

*If crypto as a whole moves at light speed, Solana's ecosystem basically warps time.*
